2. About
--------
ZDL is a frontend ("launcher") for ZDoom based Doom engine source ports. It
provides convenient interface to launch Doom engine games and their third-party
modifications (WADs) using selected source port. Launch configurations can be
saved on disc to be later used by ZDL to quickly launch selected game or
modification. ZDL can also be used to launch multiplayer sessions.

3. Where to get
---------------
You can compile binary by yourself (refer to COMPILE that comes with the 
sources) or download binary distribution from GitHub releases section. Project
homepage at GitHub:

	https://github.com/spacebub/qzdl
	
4. Installation and usage
-------------------------
ZDL is distributed as a single portable executable. Just copy it somewhere and
run it. On Windows executable additionally requires Microsoft Visual C++ 2010
SP1 x86 redistributable package to be installed on the machine. If it's not
already installed, download it from here:

	https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328
	
Linux distribution of ZDL is tested to be working with most popular modern
distros. If it's not working for you, check that all binary dependencies are
met (listed in DEPENDS file). If dependencies are satisfied but binary still
fails to run, the only option is to compile ZDL from the sources.
	
ZDL is just a frontend, you should get Doom source port and needed game assets
(IWADs and PWADs) separately.

ZDL interface should be self-explanatory to someone familiar with Doom source
ports. There are two tabs: first one is used to configure launch options for
selected source port and the second one is used to manage collection of IWADs
and source ports. Button with a down arrow on the first tab opens additional
panel with multiplayer options. For the quickstart:

    1) Switch to the second tab and add IWADs and source ports

        a) Drag and drop IWAD files to IWAD list

        b) Drag and drop source port executables to source port list

    2) Switch to the first tab and configure launch options 
	
        a) Select source port from source port drop-down list

        b) Select IWAD from the IWAD list

        c) If necessary, add any additional files (PWADs, configs, patches) by
           dragging and dropping them to external file list

    3) Click 'Launch' button to launch source port using current configuration

    4) ZDL automatically saves IWADs and source ports lists and, by default,
       also remembers launch configuration
